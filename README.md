## System Docs

A **Python** code for fitting the flux variability of light-curves to extract flux rising and falling times. 
This is a private repository containing the project I developed for fitting the light-curves data points with exponential functions, in order to determine the temporal profiles of the variability. The goodness of the fit is assessed via the normalized Chi-squared of the model and data points.

## Software Requirements

You will need to install the following software on your system in order to run/edit the Python script.
* Mac OS/ Ubuntu 18.04 OS
* Python 3.7
* Textedit/ IDE - spyder or jupyter-notebook
* Python libraries
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Scipy
